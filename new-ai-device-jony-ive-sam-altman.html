        <p>Now that Sam & Jony are rumored to be working on smart earrings, just a gentle reminder: I thought about it before it was mainstream. ðŸ˜„</p>

        <p>The idea first came to me after seeing the Humane AI Pin and other pendant-style wearables aimed at similar use cases. While the technology was compelling, the form factor wasn't. These devices were just too noticeable.</p>
        <p>That's the same problem most AI glasses have faced. When a device makes itself the center of attention, it breaks the subtlety that everyday interactions rely on. As a user, you don't want the first thing someone notices about you to be the device you're wearing.</p>
        <p>That's why I find the new Meta Ray-Bans interestingâ€”they're starting to solve this by integrating tech into familiar, socially accepted forms.</p>
        <p>Overall, I'm excited to see the conversation shifting from raw tech to thoughtful design and I am hoping that we start seeing some beautifully designed digital earrings soon.</p>
